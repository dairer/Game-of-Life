# Game of Life
<i> A simulation of a famous cellular automaton </i>



### The Rules of Life

1. Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
